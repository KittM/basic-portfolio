                <p>In 2017 I graduated from Northern Arizona University with a bachelor's degree in Strategic Communication with an emphasis in advertising. Prior to graduating undergrad I worked as a graphic design and became a large format printer. </p>
                <p> As I progressed in my career my various required html coding for email marketing. I learned html and inline css through online tutorials. In Decemeber, Adobe published an article on the implications of Google's ampscript on email marketing.
                    The ampscript code will allow pages to load faster on mobile and allow users interactive with objects on a static page without redirects </p>
                <p> Previously, I tried to learn javacript on my own, but I guess I'm not stubborn enough to break it down by myself.</p>
